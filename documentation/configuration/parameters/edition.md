# Edition
{% include teams.html %}

## Description
Forces Flyway to use either Teams or Community. Should be either `-teams` or `-community` for teams or community editions respectively.

This config parameter only applies to the Command-Line version of Flyway. To change the edition of the Gradle or Maven plugins, simply change the dependency to the teams one (e.g. `compile "org.flywaydb:flyway-core:{{ site.flywayVersion }}"` -> `compile "org.flywaydb.enterprise:flyway-core:{{ site.flywayVersion }}"`).

If omitted, Flyway Command-Line will ascertain the correct version to run based on the presence of a license key and the entitlement to a Teams trial if available.

## Usage

### Commandline
```powershell
./flyway -teams info
```

FLYWAY_EDITION=teams
