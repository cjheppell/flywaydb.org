    <h1>Getting started: Making data images</h1>

    <p>
        In the previous exercise we made a new data image by making changes to a
        Spawn database and then graduating it. We can also create new data
        images from scratch. Data images can be created from
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/data-image-configuration/empty?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >empty databases</a>, from
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/data-image-configuration/backups?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >backups</a>
        and from
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/data-image-configuration/scripts?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >scripts</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Create a data image from an existing backup</h2>

    <p>
        Data images can also be created directly from backup files. The backup
        is first uploaded to the Spawn service and restored to a new database,
        before being used to create our re-usable data image. For a large backup
        file the initial upload might take some time, but after that new copies
        can be created in just a few seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Call
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/commands/spawnctl-di-create?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >create data image</a>, passing in the path to the configuration file we created:
    </p>

    <pre
        class="console"
    ><span>&gt;</span> spawnctl create data-image --file ./database-from-backup.yaml
Data image 'database-from-backup' (10001) created!</pre>

    <p>
        This data image can now be used to create multiple database copies,
        using <code>spawnctl create data-container</code> as before:
    </p>

    <pre
        class="console"
    ><span>&gt;</span> spawnctl create data-container --image database-from-backup --lifetime 1h</pre>

    <p>
        Connect to this new data container and you'll find the database just as
        though it was restored from the backup file. Unlike restoring a database
        backup though, once the data image has been created Spawn will create
        new copies in seconds, regardless of the size of the backup.
    </p>

    {% include spawn-images-query.html %}

    <p></p>
    <p>
        Besides backups, data images can also be created from empty or from
        scripts. See
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/data-image-configuration/intro?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >source configuration</a>
        for more information about creating data images from different sources.
    </p>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>

    <p>That's the basics of Spawn covered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Creating disposable copies of databases for development and testing
        </li>
        <li>Resetting those database and creating revisions to undo changes</li>
        <li>
            Creating your own data images from which to make further database
            copies
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Next learn more about the <code>spawnctl</code> commands.</p>
