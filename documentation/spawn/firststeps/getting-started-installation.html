    <h1>Getting started: Installation</h1>

    <p>
        Spawn makes it easy to create disposable copies of databases for your
        development environment, and to automate them within DevOps pipelines.
        It uses a command line interface to create and manage those copies, and
        to make scripting and automation simple.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tutorial will walk you through installing Spawn, using a database
        copy and creating an image of your own data from which you can further
        copies.

    <h2>Authenticate spawnctl with your Spawn account</h2>

    <p>Authenticate <code>spawnctl</code> to link your account</p>

    <h2>Create a copy of a sample database</h2>

    <p>
        Spawn instantly creates copies of databases as cloud-hosted containers
        and passes the connection details back to you. These copies are called
        <a href="https://docs.spawn.cc/concepts/data-container?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway" target="_blank"
            >data containers</a
        >. The data containers are created from
        <a href="https://docs.spawn.cc/concepts/data-image?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway" target="_blank"
            >data images</a>
        -- prepared images of the database you want to copy, complete with all
        the data and configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make it easy to get started we've created some
        <a href="https://docs.spawn.cc/other/public-data-images?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway" target="_blank"

        >
        based on familiar sample databases.

        In the next section, we'll learn how to do more with your data container
        than just connect to it.
