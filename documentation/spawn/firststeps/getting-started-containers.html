    <h1>Getting started: Using data containers</h1>

    <p>
        The state of a Spawn data container can easily be saved so that you can
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>undo mistakes</li>
        <li>return to previous states</li>
        <li>store the state to make further copies from</li>
    </ul>

        before going further.

    <h2>Accidentally delete data from the database</h2>

    <p>
        We're going to pretend to make a mistake with the database, deleting
        some data that we didn't intend to. Using the connection details,
        connect to the database using your preferred client and delete all the
        records from a table:
    </p>

    {% include spawn-containers-delete.html %}

    <h2>Reset the database to its original state</h2>

    <p>
        Normally we'd now need to restore the data from a backup, but Spawn
        allows you return the database to its original state in just a few
        seconds using the
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/commands/spawnctl-dc-reset?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >reset data container</a>
        command:
    </p>

    <pre
        class="console"
    ><span>&gt;</span> spawnctl reset data-container spawn-tutorial</pre>

    <p>
        Reconnect to the database and check -- the data we just deleted is
        restored, undoing the mistake.
    </p>

    <h2>Make some changes you'd like to keep</h2>

    <p>
        What if you want to keep changes that you've made, so that a reset will
        only return to that point? You can save the state of your database at
        any time using the
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/commands/spawnctl-dc-save?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >save data container</a>
        command.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's add a new table and some data to our database. Use your database
        client to execute the following:
    </p>

    {% include spawn-containers-create.html %}

    <h2>Save the new state as a "revision"</h2>

    <p>
        We can save the current state of the database as a new revision. This is
        the default state that reset will return to. Each time you use the
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/commands/spawnctl-dc-save?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >save data container</a>
        command it will create a new revision.
    </p>

    <pre
        class="console"
    ><span>&gt;</span> spawnctl save data-container spawn-tutorial</pre>

    <pre class="console">
Successfully saved data container 'spawn-tutorial'
New revision is 'rev.1'</pre>

    <div class="well well-small">
        <strong>Note:</strong> You can use the
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/commands/spawnctl-dc-load?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >load data container</a>
        command to return to states other than the current revision.
    </div>

    <h2>Store the state to make further copies</h2>

    <p>
        The revisions that we've created only exist for as long as the data
        container lives -- if we delete the data container the revisions will be
        lost. To store a revision for later use we need to use the
        <a
            href="https://docs.spawn.cc/commands/spawnctl-dc-graduate?utm_source=flyway&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=spawn_first_steps&utm_id=flyway"
            target="_blank"
            >graduate data container</a>
        command, creating a persistent data image that can be used to create new
        data containers.
    </p>

    <pre
        class="console"
    ><span>&gt;</span> spawnctl graduate data-container spawn-tutorial --revision rev.1 --name spawn-tutorial-new-table</pre>

    <pre class="console">
Successfully graduated data container 'spawn-tutorial' at revision 'rev.1' to a new data-image
New image 'spawn-tutorial-new-table' (97480) available!</pre>

    <p>The new image appears in the list of available data images:</p>

    <pre class="console"><span>&gt;</span> spawnctl get data-images</pre>

    <p>
        This data image includes the new table that we added to our database,
        and can be used to create new data containers whenever we need them:
    </p>

    <pre
        class="console"
    ><span>&gt;</span> spawnctl create data-container --image spawn-tutorial-new-table --lifetime 1h</pre>

    <p>
        In the next section, we'll learn how to create a data-image from a
        backup file containing your data.
